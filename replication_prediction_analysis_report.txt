REPLICATION & PREDICTION ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================

OBJECTIVE: Test within-person replication and prediction of CAP-emotion relationships
DESIGN: Multi-session design with different episodes per run
ANALYSIS: Session 1 vs Session 2 replication + Session 1→Session 2 prediction

1. REPLICATION ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Session-wise CAP-emotion correlation summary:
  Session 1: Mean r = 0.090 (SD = 0.314)
  Session 2: Mean r = 0.156 (SD = 0.281)
  Significant correlations - Session 1: 3
  Significant correlations - Session 2: 2

2. PREDICTION ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Model performance summary (Session 1 → Session 2 prediction):

Valence Prediction:
  Linear Regression: R² = -0.663, RMSE = 1.726, r = 0.238
  Ridge Regression: R² = -0.388, RMSE = 1.576, r = 0.220
  Lasso Regression: R² = -0.154, RMSE = 1.437, r = 0.176
  Random Forest: R² = -0.038, RMSE = 1.364, r = 0.095 (BEST)
  Top features: CAP_4_frequency_pct, CAP_5_transition_rate, CAP_1_avg_dwell_time, CAP_5_transitions_out, CAP_5_frequency_pct

Arousal Prediction:
  Linear Regression: R² = -8.784, RMSE = 3.887, r = -0.100
  Ridge Regression: R² = -3.153, RMSE = 2.533, r = -0.093
  Lasso Regression: R² = -0.766, RMSE = 1.652, r = 0.018
  Random Forest: R² = -0.234, RMSE = 1.381, r = -0.060 (BEST)
  Top features: CAP_1_frequency_pct, CAP_5_frequency_pct, CAP_2_frequency_pct, CAP_3_frequency_pct, CAP_5_transition_rate

Prediction Summary:
  Emotions with successful prediction (R² > 0.1): 0/2
  Mean best R² across emotions: -0.136
  Max R² achieved: -0.038

3. INTERPRETATION & IMPLICATIONS
----------------------------------------
REPLICATION FINDINGS:

PREDICTION FINDINGS:
- WEAK predictive power: Limited ability to predict emotions from CAPs

CONCLUSIONS:
- Within-person CAP-emotion relationships tested across multiple sessions
- Results inform reliability and generalizability of CAP-based emotion models
- Framework applicable to real multi-session neuroimaging studies
