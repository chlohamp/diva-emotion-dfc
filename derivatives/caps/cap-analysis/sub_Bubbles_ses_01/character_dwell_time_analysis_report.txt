CHARACTER DWELL TIME ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================

ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
-----------------
This analysis examined how CAP dwell time varies with character presence.
Dwell time = average number of consecutive TRs spent in each CAP state.
Conditions defined by character appearances on screen.
Characters analyzed: Mike Wheeler, Eleven, Nancy

Total conditions analyzed: 42
Participants: 3
Condition duration range: 1.5s - 1.5s

CHARACTER PRESENCE STATISTICS:
  Mike Wheeler: 3/42 conditions (7.1%)
  Eleven: 18/42 conditions (42.9%)
  Nancy: 21/42 conditions (50.0%)

ANOVA RESULTS: DWELL TIME BY CHARACTER PRESENCE
-----------------------------------------------
Total ANOVA tests performed: 12
Significant differences found: 1

SIGNIFICANT ANOVA RESULTS:

CAP_2_avg_dwell_time - Mike Wheeler:
  F(1, 40) = 4.571, p = 0.039
  Effect: Dwell time is higher when Mike Wheeler is present
  Present: M = 1.00 (n = 3)
  Absent: M = 0.38 (n = 39)
  Effect size: d = 1.281 (large)

INTERPRETATION:
Significant ANOVA results indicate that dwell time in these CAP states
differs significantly when specific characters are on screen vs. absent.
