==================================================
* p < 0.05

INTERPRETATION:
- Positive correlations: Higher character significance → more CAP activity
- Negative correlations: Higher character significance → less CAP activity
- This extends emotional arousal analysis to socioemotional arousal
- Results inform brain-social processing relationships
